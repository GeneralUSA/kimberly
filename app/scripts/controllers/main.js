 * Hi Kimberly, this is the Javascript code for the home page, that corresponds to app/views/main.html
 *
 * When you have time, research MVC (Model View Controller) coding, and Object Oriented Programming
 *
 * The .controller('MainCtrl'), is the name of the controller. If you take a look at /app/scripts/app.js, you will see a table of contents, which
 * uses this javascript file, and app/views/main.html.
